# Basic Equation Solver

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Flask

## 1. Getting Started

We recommend using a virtual environment (venv)

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd my_flask_project
```

Create a new virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS and Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Flask

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:

```
pip install Flask
```

### 5. Run the application

Start the Flask development server:

```
flask run
```

By default, the application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 6. Deactivate the virtual environment

When you're done working with the project, deactivate the virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```
